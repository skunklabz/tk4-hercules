### Step 2: Create a Simple COBOL Program
From RFE, create a new dataset:
```tso
ALLOCATE 'HERC01.TEST.COBOL' NEW SPACE(1,1) TRACKS
```

Then edit it and enter this simple COBOL program:
```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. HELLO.
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       DATA DIVISION.
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           DISPLAY 'HELLO, MAINFRAME WORLD!'.
           STOP RUN.
```

### Step 3: Compile and Run
Create a JCL job to compile and run your program:
```jcl
//HERC01A JOB (ACCT),'HELLO WORLD',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A
//STEP1   EXEC COBOL
//SYSIN   DD DSN=HERC01.TEST.COBOL,DISP=SHR
//SYSLIN  DD DSN=HERC01.TEST.OBJ,DISP=(NEW,PASS)
//STEP2   EXEC PGM=LOADER
//SYSLIN  DD DSN=HERC01.TEST.OBJ,DISP=SHR
//SYSLMOD DD DSN=HERC01.TEST.LOAD,DISP=(NEW,PASS)
